## Scenario
You have been working in a web development agency for a few weeks now. After successfully integrating a few websites (HTML/CSS), we entrust you with a new mission.

Your customer is Kanap, a sofa brand that sells its products exclusively from its shop. Today, it would like to have an e-commerce platform in addition to its physical store to sell its products on the Internet.

As part of this mission, you work with a team consisting of:

* Corinne, the agency’s CTO
* Frank, the front-end developer who integrated the static model of the site;
* Bilal, the backend developer that implements the API to which the front-end is connected.

Corinne sends you an email to brief you on the mission:

>From: Corinne

>To: You

>Subject: Kanap e-commerce site 

>Hello!

>As we discussed yesterday, here is the information so that you can start implementing the Kanap site dynamically. 

>Here are the different tasks you will need to complete:

>Unify the work already done by the team by dynamically integrating API elements into different web pages with JavaScript. The code of the front-end and the API is available on this repo.
Set up an acceptance test plan from this template that we usually use.
For more details, here are the technical and functional specifications of the project. You will find all the details of it, the expectations for each page of the website and the details of the API. 

>Don’t hesitate to come see me if you have any questions, my door is always open.

>Have a nice day,

>Corinne

A little later, Frank sends you an email to give you some additional details about his work:

>From: Frank

>To: You

>Static models of the Kanap site 

>Hi,

>Obviously it’s time for you to join the project! So I come to give you some information on the part that I could realize, to help you during your development.

>4 pages have been set up: home page, product page, cart page and confirmation page. On all pages, all static parts are in place, so they are ready to receive dynamic content.

>Also, on each page, an example of the dynamic part is systematically given; in this way, you do not have to deal with the implementation of the HTML structure or the CSS style, everything is already done. You just have to integrate these elements dynamically thanks to JS and the API.

>Finally, in the HTML code I have integrated “id” in different tags, this should help you integrate the dynamic elements. With all this, normally you won’t need to touch the HTML/CSS code.

>Good development!

>Frank

That’s it, you have all the information to start your project. Good luck!
